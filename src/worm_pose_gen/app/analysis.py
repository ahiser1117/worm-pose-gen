"""Analyse: one workspace per recording, run with its setup's models (``docs/APP_SIMPLIFICATION.md`` section 2).

A recording belongs to a setup (:func:`library.setup_for_recording`), and
the setup names the default model of each role (``mask``: the segmenter
whose masks the pipeline fits; ``body``: the body-field network that scores
the fits and gives the A-P field).  **Opening** a recording makes its
workspace if it has none (always the whole recording; a developer may give
a range) and starts nothing; the analysis starts from the workspace.
**Analyse** takes the setup's models, or the ones the user picked instead,
and where the masks come from (``mask_source``: the mask model, the default,
or the body model's own mask output, which then needs no mask model),
resolves each reference to its weights, takes the pipeline settings the
user changed (``PIPELINE_SETTINGS``), records the setup, the model
references, the mask source and the pipeline settings in the workspace
settings (the header, the export and the next Analyse read them back), and
submits one job of kind ``analyse`` that
runs the default stages in one process (``pipeline.stages_command``), so its
progress spans the whole analysis and it survives the browser closing.
Analysing again replaces the poses; the user's mask edits stay.  The
analysis is cancelled like any job (``POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel``).

**Status** answers what the Recordings screen and the Workspace header show
without loading a workspace's arrays: the models, the analysis job and its
progress, and the state (``not_analysed``, ``queued``, ``analysing``,
``failed``, ``cancelled``, ``analysed``, ``issues``, ``reviewed``,
``exported``).  ``failed`` and ``cancelled`` are only for a workspace that
has never been analysed; a re-analysis that fails or is cancelled leaves
the state of the previous analysis.  The issue
counts come from the summary the Issues panel last wrote
(:func:`inspection.cached_issue_summary`); until the workspace is opened
after an analysis they are unknown and the state is ``analysed``.

The **kymograph** is the curvature along the body over time: one column per
workspace row, one row per midline point head to tail, the signed curvature
times the body length (dimensionless, so worms of any size and pixel size
compare) clipped to ``±KYMOGRAPH_RANGE``.  It goes to the browser as one
8-bit PNG: 0 where the frame has no pose, else ``1 + round(254 * (kL +
R) / 2R)`` (128 is straight).  Beside it goes a second 8-bit PNG of the
same size, 255 where the midline point lies outside the frame (the part of
the body the fit completed off camera), else 0; ``null`` when the
recording's frame size is unknown.
