"""A store of short unlabeled video segments for semi-supervised training of the body-field network.

Semi-supervised training (:mod:`semi_supervised`) needs windows of a few
consecutive frames, each with the ``MAX_LAG`` frames of context its
difference channels read, from as many recordings as possible.  Reading them
from the raw HDF5 files at training time is slow (NFS, chunked datasets), so
a fixed sample of contiguous segments is flat-fielded once, exactly as the
pipeline does it (:meth:`pipeline.Frames.corrected`), and kept as uint8
arrays:

    <root>/index.json                       the segments and how they were drawn
    <root>/segments/<recording>_<start>.npy  [length, H, W] uint8
    <root>/flat_fields/<recording>.npz       the flat fields used (pipeline cache format)

Segments are spread over the recordings (a few per recording rather than
many from one, for diversity of animals, days and illumination) and never
contain a frame that :func:`temporal_eval.excluded` rejects (test and ood
recordings, evaluation clips with their margin) or a frame of a recording the
caller excludes (the validation split, so early stopping stays honest).  A
recording that cannot be read (the store1 HDF5 corruption) is skipped.
